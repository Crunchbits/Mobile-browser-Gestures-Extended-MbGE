- This is primarily an English translation but also offers slight modifications. 
- Translation was 100% created with the use of Google translate + resonable/safe judgements and careful selection to ensure consistent variable/function names.
- Translations may not be fully accurate, but are more than sufficient to navigate through the majority, if not the entire script.
